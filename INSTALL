This is the installation instructions for Rodney::XML::QuickStruct.

This package installs as just the module file. While there is an example script,
there are no tests. This file is mostly here just as a place holder.


===> To install

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make install


If you want to check it out before use, run make and then use the example.pl
script in this directory. If you're happy, then run 'make install'.
