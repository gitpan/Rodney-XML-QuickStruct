This is the README file for Rodney::XML::QuickStruct.


===> To install

See INSTALL file.


===> Examples

In this directory you should have a program named "example.pl", and several
example XML files. Run the program like this:

  % ./example.pl ex1.xml

This program is a simple and useful example of API usage, and the XML samples
should be good theory for those who need it. Of coarse, make sure to read the
docs that are in the POD of this package.

Note, you don't have to install this package to make the example program work,
but you will have to run the make to build the lib directory needed.
